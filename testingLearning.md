just example : But, as you can see, our UserService functions are dependent on the PrismaService. We need to isolate the functions from PrismaService,why ?

1.By isolating the function from its dependencies, we can focus solely on the logic of our function.

2.Our test can be designed more efficiently because we donâ€™t have to deal with the complexity of external dependency, especially in Test Driven Development.

3.Introduces more control to our input and output prediction/assertion. Our test environment will be more stable and reproducible.
